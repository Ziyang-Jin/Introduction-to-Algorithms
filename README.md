# Introduction-to-Algorithms

In the famous book "Introduction to Algorithms", all the algorithms are described as pseudo-code, I am trying to translate those pseudo-code into programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Haskell.

Also, I am trying to solve some exercises on my own and write the answer using LaTeX.
